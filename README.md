Just like my JS implementation, it supports negatives. ~It also supports multiple bases/radices~ (not anymore, sorry üôÅ, I'll fix later).

The rationale behind the multi-base support, is that CC is more interesting and helpful to explore/experiment in **bases 2 & 3** and any other base whose factors are 2 and/or 3, and bases whose factors are +-1 offset from 2 and/or 3, so I had to add all bases from 1 to 10 (and hexdec, because it's binary in disguise)

I did some benchmarks and it's **EXTREMELY FASTER** than the JS counterpart at checking nums!
